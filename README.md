# DATA STRUCTURE LIBRARY

This is my own implementation of various Data Structures in C language.

## Usage

1. Download .zip from this repository
2. Go to your project directory
```
cd your-project/
```
3. Unzip the files into your project directory
```
unzip ~/Downloads/datastrlib-main.zip
```
4. Create main.c and add these header files:
```
#include <stdbool.h>
#include "datastrlib-main/include/queues.h"
#include "datastrlib-main/include/stacks.h"
```
5. Have fun
